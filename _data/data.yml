    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm Alexandre, a bioinformatic scientist with interests in DNA, genes, genomes, and softwares.
      My current role focuses on genomics and evolution of smallest eukaryotic genomes.
      My previous experiences cover a broad range of genomics research: developing pipeline for non-invasive
      prenatal diagnosis and cancer diagnosis; assembling, annotating, and profiling the genomes of brown algae
      for functional and evolutionary analysis of sex determination; integrating tools into Galaxy plateform
      for Biologists.
      I'm enthusiastic and follow the evolutions of sequencing technologies.

        Project : Genetic Bases and Evolutionary Consequences of Symbiont-Driven Sex Determination
        
        The aim of the project was to uncover the molecular genetic basis of microsporidia-mediated feminization.
        It consists of comparing genomes of closely related microsporidia inducing feminization or not in their hosts
        by sequencing the genomes of microsporidia species. It's also includ the genome assembly of
        Armadillidium vulgare WulC an isopod with an insertion of the prokaryote genome Wolbachia.
        
        - Genome assembly (Illumina / PacBio) and/or annotation and NCBI submission of eukaryotic genomes (microsporidia, amphipod, isopod, red and brown algae), mitogenomes and virus

        The second part of the project was to evaluate the feasibility of using Whole
        Genome Sequencing for clinical diagnosis. The last part of the project was to
        establish the correlation between host genetic variations and impacts on the

        Project: Brown algae model for the evolutionary and functional analysis
        of genetic sex determination
        
        Aims of my PhD were to reconstruct the sex chromosome and study genes that
        are expressed specifically or preferentially in each of the two sexes of Ectocarpus siliculosus. The structure
        of the sex chromosomes was identified and compared with the autosomes to
        study their particular evolution. RNA-seq data were used to identify the regulatory
        and metabolic pathways involved in sex determination and differentiation in
        this brown alga. The project include a complete re-annotation of the Ectocarpus
        genome that was carried out at the VIB lab in Ghent and an identification of
        small RNAs (mi, sno, lncRNA).
        
        - Transcriptomic analysis - de novo and with reference, counting, differential expression and validation (RT-qPCR)
        - Genome assembly (Sanger, Roche 454, Illumina, PacBio) of 2 females and the sex chomosome of the male genome of Ectocarpus siliculosus
        - Genome annotation of Ectocarpus subulatus and re-annotation of Ectocarpus siliculosus
        - Statistics and graphics (R, ggplot2)
        - Python 2, Perl, Bash, R
        - Cluster - SGE
        - Illustrations, mainly with Illustrator and a little bit with Photoshop
        - Formations for students and researchers (Cluster initation, AVIESAN-IFB bioinformatic school, Linux scripting)

        Project: Development of workflow for data analysis under the Galaxy platform
        
        The aim of the project was to develop the utilization of the Galaxy platform
        and integrate developed tools at the Station Biologique de Roscoff. The mission include
        support for several bioanalysis projects.
        
        - Transcriptomic analysis - de novo assembly and differential expression - of various species (krill, sea urchin, alligator)
