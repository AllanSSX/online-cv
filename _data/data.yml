        The aim of the project was to uncover the molecular genetic basis of microsporidia-
        mediated feminization. It consist of comparing genomes of closely
        related microsporidia inducing feminization or not in their hosts by sequencing
        the genomes microsporidia species.

      company: Inserm - UMR1078 / CHRU Morvan, Brest
      details: |
        The first part of the project was to develop Ion Torrent plugins to integrate
        bioinformatics tools in cancer and non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. It also
        include the establishment of an automated archive system of sequencing data.
        The second part of the project was to evaluate the feasibility of using Whole
        Genome Sequencing for clinical diagnosis. The last part of the project was to
        establish the correlation between host genetic variations and impacts on the
        microbiome in cystic fibrosis.

      details: |
        Aims of my PhD were to reconstruct the sex chromosome and study genes that
        are expressed specifically or preferentially in each of the two sexes. The structure
        of the sex chromosomes was identified and compared with the autosomes to
        study their particular evolution. RNA-seq data were used to identify the regulatory
        and metabolic pathways involved in sex determination and differentiation in
        this brown alga. The project include a complete re-annotation of the Ectocarpus
        genome that was carried out at the VIB lab in Ghent and an identification of
        small RNAs (mi, sno, lncRNA).
